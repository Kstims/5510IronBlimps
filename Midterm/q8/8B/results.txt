The YOLO algorithm was extremely fast, much faster than running the CNN.
Upon testing, I was able to conduct dozens of epochs in the same timespan as it took me to run several on the CNN.

The CNN took a two stage approach to analyzing images, first detecting objects of interest within a given frame
And then moving through a second time to analyze each object and determine its identity.

On the other hand, Yolo passes through the image once to detect an object and analyze it at the same time.
